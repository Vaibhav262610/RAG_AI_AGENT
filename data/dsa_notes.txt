# Data Structures and Algorithms Notes

## What is Recursion?
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.
Every recursive function must have:
- Base case
-kuch nahi aata
- Recursive case

Without a base case, recursion will cause stack overflow.

## What is Stack?
A stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In First Out).
Operations:
- push
- pop
- top

Used in:
- Function calls
- Undo/Redo
- Expression evaluation

## Hashing
Hashing is used to store data in constant time complexity.
It uses a hash function to map keys to indexes.

## Time Complexity
- O(1): Constant
- O(log n): Binary search
- O(n): Linear search
- O(n log n): Merge sort
